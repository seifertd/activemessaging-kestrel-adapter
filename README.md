activemessaging-kestrel-adapter
===========

This is an adapter to the kestrel messaging server for the ActiveMessaging framework.  It is 
in the early stages of development.

Features
--------

* send to any queue
* receive from any subscribed queue

Examples
--------

    require 'activemessaging-kestrel-adapter'

    # configure ActiveMessaging broker in an appropriate broker.yml file:
    # development:
    #   adapter: kestrel
    #   servers: localhost:22133
    #   retry_policy:
    #     strategy: SimpleRetry
    #     config: 
    #       tries: 1
    #       delay: 5
    # the retry_policy: second is optional and should be left out under
    # most circumstances (see below).
    config = YAML.load(File.read("broker.yml"))

    adapter = ActiveMessaging::Adapter::Kestrel::Connection.new(config[:development])

    adapter.send("arbitrarily_named_queue", "message as string")
    adapter.subscribe("queue1")
    adapter.subscribe("queue2")
    adapter.receive # get a message from any of the subscribed queues, or nil if they are all empty

Configuration
-------------

See the ActiveMessaging project for details of broker configuration.  This
Kestrel adapter can be configured with a retry_policy, but it is not 
necessary to do so as a sensible default will be used if the configuration
is not present.  The default policy is as shown above.  The default
policy in the face of receive exceptions is to sleep 5 seconds, then retry
once.  If an exception still occurs, it is raised.  The strategy must
refer to a class that once instantiated, responds to the do_work() method.
The method must take a options hash.  The value of the options hash will 
be the config: key in the configuration file.  For 99% of use cases, you
should not even bother defining the retry_policy as the default is fine.
The ability to override the policy is provided for edge cases.

Requirements
------------

* memcached-client

Future
------

* Handle a cluster of kestrel servers
* Write some tests (need a mock kestrel service?)

Install
-------

* gem install activemessaging-kestrel-adapter
