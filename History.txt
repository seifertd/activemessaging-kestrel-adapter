== 1.0.0 / 2012-01-17
* Change dependencies for Rails/activesupport 3.1.3.  This version is not compatible
  with Rails 2.3.X.  Use 0.0.5 for Rails 2.3.X.

== 0.0.5 / 2011-02-27
* Clean up retry_policy initialization.  Make sure the logger is set correctly.
* Avoid reinstantiating a new retry policy object each time through the
  receive method.  Create and reuse one object when the adapter is created.
* Make the empty_queues_delay default to nil, or no sleep at all, for cases
  where the adapter is used outside of the ActiveMessaging::Gateway receive
  loop

== 0.0.4 / 2011-02-15
* Add a queue_stats method to get stats on server queues from the adapter.

== 0.0.3 / 2011-02-05
* Introduce a 0.1 second sleep in #receive if no subscribed queues have a message
  to avoid spin loops in the ActiveMessaging Gateway.  This is a bug, IMHO, in
  ActiveMessaging.
* Fix bugs in receive loop to match new ActiveMessaging 0.7.1 API

== 0.0.2 / 2011-02-03
* Implement simple retry in the face of receive errors to avoid log spew
  by the ActiveMessaging Gateway as it retries over and over.  Extensible
  with other retry policies.
* Works with ActiveMessaging up to version 0.7.1
* Add some configuration tests

== 0.0.1 / 2011-02-02
* First release, actually works in a Rails application.

== 0.0.0 / 2011-01-31

* 1 major enhancement
  * Birthday!
